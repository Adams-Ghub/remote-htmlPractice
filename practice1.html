		There are many tags in the html language library and one may want to commit all these tags to memory but guess what, you don't need to do as it sticks so long as you practice as a professional web developer. however, you can check  it out whenever you want to find out about any tag you forget about online.

	<p>
		In order to make code easier to read, web page authors often add extra spaces or start some elements on new lines.

This is known as white space collapsing.
